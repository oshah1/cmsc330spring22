# opam mingw repository

An opam repository for windows - including an experimental build of opam
for windows (of course, you still need cygwin for nearly everything:
a shell interpreter to run configure scripts, git, rsync, ...)

## Discontinuation

This repo will soon be
[discontinued](https://fdopen.github.io/opam-repository-mingw/2021/02/26/repo-discontinued/).

## Homepage

There is now a small homepage with installation instructions and usage
information: https://fdopen.github.io/opam-repository-mingw/ - and a
[graphical installer](https://fdopen.github.io/opam-repository-mingw/installation/) that
automates the steps listed below.

## Esy

[Esy](https://esy.sh/) also supports Windows. If you are not already
familar with opam from Linux / OS X and don't want to change your
habits, give it a try first.

## Summary

### Download

* [32-bit](https://github.com/fdopen/opam-repository-mingw/releases/download/0.0.0.2/opam32.tar.xz)
* [64-bit](https://github.com/fdopen/opam-repository-mingw/releases/download/0.0.0.2/opam64.tar.xz)

The archives contain native versions of opam, flexdll and aspcud. They
are all not linked against cygwin1.dll, so you can use them with
either the 32-bit or 64-bit version of cygwin.


### Installation

* First install [cygwin](https://cygwin.com/) and a few additionals
  packages: rsync, patch, diffutils, curl, make, unzip, git, m4, perl,
  and of course mingw64-i686-gcc-core and/or mingw64-x86_64-gcc-core.

* If your logon name contains whitespace characters (e.g. 'Firstname
  Lastname') or any other character that would require quoting inside
  a unix shell or cmd.exe, follow the instructions at
  https://www.cygwin.com/faq.html#faq.setup.name-with-space

* Then proceed inside a cygwin shell:

```bash
$ tar -xf 'opam32.tar.xz' # or tar -xf 'opam64.tar.xz'
$ bash opam32/install.sh  # --prefix /usr/foo, the default prefix is /usr/local
                          # maybe you have to add /usr/local/bin to your PATH
$ opam init default "https://github.com/fdopen/opam-repository-mingw.git#opam2" -c "ocaml-variants.4.07.1+mingw32" --disable-sandboxing
# or, if you prefer the 64-bit version - 'opam switch -a' will list other supported versions
$ opam init default "https://github.com/fdopen/opam-repository-mingw.git#opam2" -c "ocaml-variants.4.07.1+mingw64" --disable-sandboxing
$ eval $(ocaml-env cygwin)
```

## Things to remember

* Add `/usr/i686-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/bin` (or
  `/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/bin`) to your $PATH, if you
  use
  [depext-cygwinports](https://fdopen.github.io/opam-repository-mingw/depext-cygwin/)

* Consider to use windows symlinks inside cygwin: `export
  CYGWIN='winsymlinks:native'`. Otherwise ocamlbuild and many build
  and test scripts will create symlinks, that are only understood by
  cygwin tools, but not by the OCaml compiler and other native windows
  programs.  (Usually only adminstrators are allowed to create
  symlinks. But you can change the default settings, see
  [this post](https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2013-05/msg00405.html) for
  details)
